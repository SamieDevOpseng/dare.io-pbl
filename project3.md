## SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

In this project, i will be implementing web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

#### MERN Web stack consists of following components:

MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.

ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

I opened my AWS account and created an EC2 instance, added Tag Project3_MERN
